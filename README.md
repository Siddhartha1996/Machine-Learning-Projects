# Machine-Learning-Projects

Here, you can find multiple projects on Machine Learning that I worked upon. You can find data analysis, and the implementation of various prediction machine learning models. 
I used various types of datasets to work upon in order to carry out statistical analysis, predictions and tried to get significant results out. Data sets are numerical in nature.
